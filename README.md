    TMJudge: A Code Judge Environment
    Copyright (C) 2018 Thales Menezes

    Philosophy:
        A Code Judge should be a tool to guide student's programmin' learning,
        a environment to correct and show errors as opportunities for growth;
        while also assisting teachers and tutors with class management, giving
        more time to address specific or theorical questions with the student.

        To achieve this, the judge can not be viewed by students as a foe
        to be defeated; or a buggy program to appologize for it's flaws
        in a attempt to keep the student motivated.
        
        The judge should be as independent, well polished and communicative as
        possible, it should be a arrow pointing in a direction, when necessary,
        instead of a riddle to be solved in every single feature.

:innocent: Append and modify this list as you make changes to this repository

- [ ] unchecked example
- [x] checked example

:octocat: Thank you  

TODOs:
- [ ] Find a way to make this statement generic
    ```python
    import sys
    sys.path.append('src/')
    from module import *
    ```
    - Possible solution by using `importlib`
- [ ] Add support to input

Solved:
- [x] Review the way to run the subject' code: I worry about it's safety and usability towards the server 
    ```python
    subprocess.run(*args, shell=True)
    ```
    - Possibly worrying more than necessary, considerating it's most likely to be used with beginner programmers and the _`shell commands`_ are "hardcoded".
        - Solution: instead of using `subprocess` module we can use python' built-in `exec()` and `eval()` passing in as a `*arg` the subject' code. This provides more security to server (since we don't need to access the shell anymore) and flexibility (we can insert lines of code to extract usefull information about the code being tested) without analysing the code for "malicious intent"(may be a feature on later versions); besides, less modules needed.
